# Build and Package management

## Introduction

### Introduction



### Build & Package Management

A beginner-friendly guide to understanding how raw code becomes a deployable application — covering build tools, dependency management, artifact creation, and a complete reference project.

### Introduction

Understanding Build & Package Management is one of the most important foundations in DevOps. Before your app can run anywhere — a server, a container, or the cloud — it goes through a structured process: source code gets compiled or bundled, dependencies get pulled in, and a final deployable package gets created.

Think of it like cooking:
- Your source code = raw ingredients
- Build tool = the oven/stove
- Dependencies = spices and add-ons you buy from a store
- Artifact = the final dish, ready to serve

### Why it Matters in DevOps

- Ensures the app runs the same way in dev, staging, and production
- Automates repetitive manual steps
- Makes deployments fast and reliable
- Catches errors early (during build/test phase)

### The General Flow

```
Source Code
    |
    v
Install Dependencies  <-- package manager (npm, pip, maven)
    |
    v
Compile / Bundle      <-- build tool (webpack, go build, mvn)
    |
    v
Run Tests             <-- unit/integration tests
    |
    v
Create Artifact       <-- .jar, .whl, Docker image, binary
    |
    v
Store in Repository   <-- Nexus, Artifactory, Docker Hub
    |
    v
Deploy
```

## Build Tools

### Build Tools

Build tools automate the steps needed to turn source code into a runnable artifact. Every language ecosystem has its own tooling, but the concept is the same — take raw source files, process them, and produce something deployable.

### Common Build Tools by Language

| Language   | Build Tool(s)           | Output Artifact         |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:------------------------|
| Java       | Maven, Gradle           | `.jar`, `.war`          |
| JavaScript | npm, yarn, webpack      | bundled JS files        |
| Python     | pip, poetry, setuptools | `.whl`, `.tar.gz`       |
| Go         | `go build` (built-in)   | binary executable       |
| C/C++      | Make, CMake             | binary executable       |

### Build Lifecycle

Most build tools follow a fixed sequence of steps called a **lifecycle**. Each step depends on the previous one completing successfully.

Maven's lifecycle is a great example to understand this:

```
clean  →  validate  →  compile  →  test  →  package  →  install  →  deploy
```

- `clean` — removes old build output so you start fresh
- `compile` — turns `.java` source files into `.class` bytecode
- `test` — runs your unit tests automatically
- `package` — wraps everything into a `.jar` or `.war` file
- `install` — puts the artifact in your local Maven repository
- `deploy` — uploads the artifact to a remote repository

Other build tools have similar stages, even if the names differ.

### Common Build Commands

```bash

### Java (Maven)

mvn clean package          # clean old build + compile + test + create .jar

## Java (Gradle)

### Java (Gradle)

gradle build               # compile + test + package

### JavaScript (npm)

npm run build              # runs the build script defined in package.json

### Python

python -m build            # creates .whl and .tar.gz in /dist folder

### Go

go build -o myapp ./...    # compiles everything into a binary named myapp
```

### Dependency & Package Management

Almost no application runs in isolation. Your code relies on external libraries — pieces of code written by others that you import into your project. Managing these libraries (installing, versioning, and locking them) is what package management is all about.

## What Are Dependencies and Package Managers

### What Are Dependencies and Package Managers

A **dependency** is any external library your app needs to work. A **package manager** is the tool that fetches, installs, and manages those libraries for you.

Example: A Node.js app that sends emails might depend on the `nodemailer` library. Instead of writing email-sending logic yourself, you install nodemailer and use it.

| Language   | Package Manager | Config File       | Lock File           |
|:-----------|:----------------|:------------------|:--------------------|
| JavaScript | npm, yarn, pnpm | `package.json`    | `package-lock.json` |
| Python     | pip, poetry     | `pyproject.toml`  | `poetry.lock`       |
| Java       | Maven           | `pom.xml`         | (resolved at build) |
| Go         | Go Modules      | `go.mod`          | `go.sum`            |

### Version Pinning and Lock Files

When you add a dependency, you also specify which version you want. This is called **version pinning**.

```json
// package.json (Node.js)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",    // ^ = compatible updates allowed (4.x.x)
    "lodash": "~4.17.0",     // ~ = patch updates only (4.17.x)
    "axios": "1.4.0"         // exact version, never changes
  }
}
```

- `^` (caret) — allows minor and patch updates
- `~` (tilde) — allows patch updates only
- exact version — completely locked, no automatic updates

**Lock files** take this one step further — they record the exact version of every dependency (including dependencies of dependencies) that was installed.

```
Without lock file:  Dev installs axios 1.4.0, CI installs axios 1.5.1 → different behavior
With lock file:     Both always install axios 1.4.0 → reproducible builds
```

Always commit your lock file to version control. It is the guarantee of reproducibility.

### Installing Dependencies

```bash

### Node.js

npm install                       # installs from package.json, creates lock file
npm install express               # adds a new dependency

### Python (pip)

pip install -r requirements.txt   # installs all listed packages

## Python (poetry)

### Python (poetry)

poetry install                    # installs from pyproject.toml + poetry.lock

### Java (Maven)

mvn dependency:resolve            # downloads all dependencies from pom.xml

### Go

go mod tidy                       # installs/removes based on go.mod
```

### Artifact Creation & Storage

After a successful build, the output is called an **artifact** — the thing you actually deploy. Managing artifacts properly (naming, versioning, storing) is critical for reliable deployments.

### Artifact Types and Repositories

An artifact is the packaged output of a build. Different ecosystems produce different artifact types.

| Language   | Artifact Type       | Description                            |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Java       | `.jar` / `.war`     | Packaged bytecode + dependencies       |
| Python     | `.whl` (wheel)      | Installable Python package             |
| Go         | binary              | Single compiled executable             |
| JavaScript | bundled `.js` files | Minified, optimized frontend code      |
| Docker     | image               | Complete app + OS layer, runs anywhere |

After building, artifacts are stored in a **repository** so they can be versioned, shared, and pulled by deployment pipelines.

| Repository       | Use Case                                        |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Nexus            | Store `.jar`, `.whl`, npm packages (self-hosted)|
| Artifactory      | Enterprise artifact storage (JFrog)             |
| Docker Hub       | Public/private Docker images                    |
| AWS ECR          | Docker images on AWS                            |
| GitHub Packages  | Packages tied to your GitHub repository         |

## Versioning Artifacts

### Versioning Artifacts

Always version your artifacts using **Semantic Versioning**:

```
v1.0.0   →  v1.0.1   patch: bug fix, no new features
         →  v1.1.0   minor: new feature, backward compatible
         →  v2.0.0   major: breaking change
```

Never overwrite an existing version. Always produce a new version tag for every release.

### Packaging with Docker

In modern DevOps, almost every app gets packaged as a **Docker image**. An image bundles your app, its runtime, and its dependencies into a single portable unit that runs identically everywhere.

```dockerfile

### Example Dockerfile for a Python app

FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```bash

### Build the image

docker build -t myapp:v1.0.0 .

### Push to Docker Hub

docker push myusername/myapp:v1.0.0
```

## Reference Project: Python Flask App

### Reference Project: Python Flask App

A complete, working example using Python. This walks through every stage — from writing code to packaging it as a Docker image — following the full Build & Package Management lifecycle.

### Project Structure

```
flask-demo/
|-- app.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- tests/
|   `-- test_app.py
|-- Dockerfile
`-- Makefile
```

### The Application

```python

### app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return jsonify({"message": "Build & Package Demo", "status": "ok"})

@app.route("/health")
def health():
    return jsonify({"status": "healthy"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### Dependencies, Tests & Build

**Step 1 — Declare dependencies** in `requirements.txt` with exact versions for reproducibility:

```
flask==3.0.0
pytest==7.4.3
```

**Step 2 — Set up the environment and install:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3 — Write a test** so the build pipeline can verify correctness before packaging:

```python

## tests/test_app.py

### tests/test_app.py

import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.config["TESTING"] = True
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_home(client):
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.get_json()["status"] == "ok"

def test_health(client):
    response = client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.get_json()["status"] == "healthy"
```

**Step 4 — Run tests:**

```bash
pytest tests/

### Expected output:



### collected 2 items



### tests/test_app.py ..     [100%]



### ====== 2 passed in 0.45s ======

```

## Docker Image & Makefile Automation

### Docker Image & Makefile Automation

**Step 5 — Package into a Docker image:**

```dockerfile

# Dockerfile

FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

```bash
docker build -t flask-demo:v1.0.0 .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-demo:v1.0.0

# Verify

curl http://localhost:5000/

# {"message": "Build & Package Demo", "status": "ok"}

```

**Step 6 — Tie everything together with a Makefile:**

```makefile
.PHONY: install test build run all

install:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

test:
	pytest tests/

build:
	docker build -t flask-demo:v1.0.0 .

run:
	docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-demo:v1.0.0

all: install test build
```

Now the entire pipeline runs with one command:

```bash
make all     # install → test → build Docker image
make run     # start the container
```

### Complete Flow Summary

```
1. Write code              app.py
          |
2. Declare dependencies    requirements.txt  (pinned versions)
          |
3. Install                 pip install -r requirements.txt
          |
4. Test                    pytest tests/  (must pass before packaging)
          |
5. Package                 docker build -t flask-demo:v1.0.0 .
          |
6. Store                   docker push → Docker Hub / ECR
          |
7. Deploy                  container runs identically in any environment
```

This is the complete Build & Package Management cycle — from raw source code to a deployable, versioned Docker image ready for any environment.
